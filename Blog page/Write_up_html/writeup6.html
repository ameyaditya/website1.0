         <p>He is like the sun who brightens her day.<br>

           Like the tress who is a shadow to her pains.<br>

           He is like the only cell who has heard the rattling noices of her fragmented heart.<br>

           Like the sea who taught her to make every instant count.<br>

           Like the moon who showed her that there is light at the end of every day.<br>

           He is like the mountains who guided her to look past the ambiguity of life.<br>

           Like the light who aided her to see the beauty in everything of her<br> 

           Unilluminated world.<br>
