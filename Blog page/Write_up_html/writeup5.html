	<div class="container text-center">
          <p>You can never dim my light,<br>
             for I emerge from a radiant star, so vast, it could swallow<br>
             the entire humanity along with its cruelty. <br>
             I belong to a family of undistinguished particles.<br>
             I wish I could spread myself to all of this world's entirety, stretch my<br>
             arms to reach the opposite poles of the Earth, to hold this universe close to my<br>
             chest, to comfort the broken shadows with my warmth, to destroy the evil with my <br>
             trenchant nature. <br>
             I wish I could make my way through quiet, empty rooms, and peek <Br>
             through dark clouds to save the land of constant showers of sorrow. <br>
             I wish I could bring all the children out  of their enclosed restlessness to <br>
             let them discover my color of happiness. <br>
             I wish I could add hopeful dreams into the conscience of <Br>
             abandoned nerves,  and help them see how bright they gleam.<br> 
             I dream, I dream and I dream until I<br>
             realize that  I'm just a function of colour and intensity, invisible<br>
             to the naked eye, perhaps even to a naked soul.<br>
             So, the next morning when  you wake up,<br>
             open the doors holding you back from soaking yourself in my shine, come out in the <br>
             open and feel my embrace, maybe then I can fulfil my desire of being your channel of <br>
             eternal joy admist the lurid insanity.<br>
         </p>
