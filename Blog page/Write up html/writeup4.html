	<h1>MUSIC</h1>

         <p>Ever engaged yourself into someone to an extent where you can feel their pain through the words they scribble and the tunes they find?<br>
            I was introduced to someone like this a few months back, Twenty one Pilots.<br>
            Their music is not just words stringed along to a rhythm, it is a healer.<br> These exceptionally talented artists take you on a ride through their life.<br>
            I have enjoyed music the fair amount, I have neither looked for hidden meanings nor have I questioned the purpose of its existence until I embarked on the journey of the Twenty one Pilots.<br>
            Music has a spellbound impact on a person which is a life saver, and I mean it literally.<br> And the Twenty one Pilots have recreated this impact to a whole new level.<br>
            When Tyler Joseph’s voice coordinates with Josh Dun’s beats and they break into a pool of emotions you will find yourself living the sound.<br>
            You may not have encountered such tremendous pain to come up with lyrics this overwhelming, but experiencing this pain will help you find a way to reach out to any kind of pain you are in. <br>

            The words fall on your ears, then gets into your head and you will truly discover the motivation each word holds. <br>
            Their soothing tunes are comforting.<br> Their music is a ray of hope for the ones living in hopelessness.<br> It is a beautiful channel to bring yourself out into, just the way you are, pure and scarred.<br> It is something to hold on to, for the ones screeching in pain.<br> 
            Their music gives life to your soul and a voice to your ache.<br>
