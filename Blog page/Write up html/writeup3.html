	<h1>MONSOON</h1>	
	</div>
	<div class="container text-center">
          <p>The monsoon showers are hitting my window panes. <br> The trees seem to shy away from the
             clouds but are bound by an unquestionable warmth by the rain at the same time.<br>
             I have always enjoyed rain.<br> I do not know if it is the way it falls in droplets of
             happiness and washes away the sorrows of the Earth, Or<br> the way it gives life to
             saplings and helps them grow into beautiful trees, Or<br> even how one forget his
             worries when it rains.<br> Maybe it is the sound of it hitting the stones and its 
             fragrance when it touches the mud along the way.<br> The magical sight and the pure joy it 
             brings to a person is a miracle.<br> Something this beautiful can heal you, even for
             those few minutes.<br> You feel like you are out in the open, with your naked, 
             raw thoughts and there is no one judging you.<br> You are free, alive and simply yourself.<br>
             I find these exact moments worth living for. There is too much struggle out there.<br> 
             Take some time out and bring yourself out to this and let the rains wash away your
             burdens too.<br></p>
