The monsoon showers are hitting my window panes. The trees seem to shy away from the
 clouds but are bound by an unquestionable warmth by the rain at the same time.
 I have always enjoyed rain. I don’t know if it’s the way it falls in droplets of
 happiness and washes away the sorrows of the Earth. Or the way it gives life to
 saplings and helps them grow into beautiful trees. Or even how one forget his
 worries when it rains. Maybe it’s the sound of it hitting the stones and its 
fragrance when it touches the mud along the way. The magical sight and the pure joy it 
brings to a person is a miracle. Something this beautiful can heal you, even for
 those few minutes. You feel like you’re out in the open, with your naked, 
raw thoughts and there is no one judging you. You’re free, alive and simply yourself.
 I find these exact moments worth living for. There is too much struggle out there. 
Take some time out and bring yourself out to this and let the rains wash away your
 burdens too.
