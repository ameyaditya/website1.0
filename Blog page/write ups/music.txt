Ever engaged yourself into someone to an extent where you can feel their pain through the words they scribble and the tunes they find?
I was introduced to someone like this a few months back, Twenty one Pilots.
Their music is not just words stringed along to a rhythm, it’s a healer. These exceptionally talented artists take you on a ride through their life.
I have enjoyed music the fair amount, I have neither looked for hidden meanings nor have I questioned the purpose of its existence until I embarked on the journey of the Twenty one Pilots.
Music has a spellbound impact on a person which is a life saver, and I mean it literally. And the Twenty one Pilots have recreated this impact to a whole new level.
When Tyler Joseph’s voice coordinates with Josh Dun’s beats and they break into a pool of emotions you will find yourself living the sound.
You may not have encountered such tremendous pain to come up with lyrics this overwhelming, but experiencing this pain will help you find a way to reach out to any kind of pain you are in .

The words fall on your ears, then gets into your head and you will truly discover the motivation each word holds. 
Their soothing tunes are comforting. Their music is a ray of hope for the ones living in hopelessness. It’s a beautiful channel to bring yourself out into, just the way you are, pure and scarred. It’s something to hold on to, for the ones screeching in pain. 
Their music gives life to your soul and a voice to your ache.
