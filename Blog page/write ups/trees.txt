He is like the sun who brightens her day.

Like the tress who is a shadow to her pains.

He is like the only cell who has heard the rattling noices of her fragmented heart.

Like the sea who taught her to make every instant count.

Like the moon who showed her that there is light at the end of every day.

He is like the mountains who guided her to look past the ambiguity of life.

Like the light who aided her to see the beauty in everything of her 
Unilluminated world.
