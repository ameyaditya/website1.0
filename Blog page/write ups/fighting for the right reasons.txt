Fighting for the right reasons.
Eons ago the world revolted against the issue of gender inequality and this fight
 continues even today. When I see people trying to reverse the dominant action between
 the two genders ,this makes me question everything  that we have been doing to
 establish equality. Feminism is aiming for equality and harmony amongst both, not 
trying to triumph one gender over the other, that is where we go wrong. Let us not 
place our victory by letting down men. The root cause for the revolt is to ensure
 equity among all, the idea is to put an end to patriarchy, not to destroy every man
 and his freedom of expression. The manner in which the nerd mentality can blind us, 
let us think for ourselves and stand up for what’s right. People often mistake
 feminism as misandry, whereas it’s the struggle for women’s rights on the ground of
 equality of both the sexes.  When we say we want equality, it means equal  dignity
 and freedom for all.It means carrying forward the legacy of powerful, strong,
 inspiring women and men and not indoctrinating the idea of  suppressing men’s 
expressions.  Let us not get carried away but what’s easy but let us get motivated 
by what’s right. Strive to stand by the good, ensure justice and  fight for the 
right cause.
