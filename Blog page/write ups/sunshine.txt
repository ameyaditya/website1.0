You can never dim my light,
for I emerge from a radiant star, so vast, it could swallow
 the entire humanity along with its cruelty. 
I belong to a family of undistinguished
 particles.
I wish I could spread myself to all of this world's entirety, stretch my
 arms to reach the opposite poles of the Earth, to hold this universe close to my
 chest, to comfort the broken shadows with my warmth, to destroy the evil with my 
trenchant nature. 
I wish I could make my way through quiet, empty rooms, and peek 
through dark clouds to save the land of constant showers of sorrow. 
I wish I could 
bring all the children out  of their enclosed restlessness to let them discover my
 color of happiness. 
I wish I could add hopeful dreams into the conscience of 
abandoned nerves,  and help them see how bright they gleam. 
I dream, I dream and I 
dream until I realize that  I'm just a function of colour and intensity, invisible
 to the naked eye, perhaps even to a naked soul.
So, the next morning when  you wake up,
 open the doors holding you back from soaking yourself in my shine, come out in the 

open and feel my embrace, maybe then I can fulfil my desire of being your channel of
 eternal joy admist the lurid insanity.
