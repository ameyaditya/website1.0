	<h1>ANXIETY</h1>

	<div class="container text-center">
		<p>
			I wake up disturbed, I slept well though.<br>
			You visit my thoughts the moment I open my eyes,<br>like the sun wakes the Earth from its dreams.<br>
			But I’m going to have a good day, I promise.<br> I see your alarming message soon after and believe otherwise.<br>
			Why do you take over my thoughts and pretend they are your toys to play with?<br>
			Why do you leave me in your ocean of uncertainties ; unattended? I’m drowning.<br>
			I met my love today. He loves me, I know. I want to say I do too.
			<br>I can see you looking at me, smiling at my innocence and I refrain from accepting the truth.<br>
			Why am I afraid of you? Why do I let you in? Why do I let you shatter me?
			<br>I’m broken pieces of glass lying on the floor.<br>
			Someone is going to bleed.<br>
			I had a long day, I wish to come home to myself but I see you waiting for me<br>in my cave. I feel your arms on my shoulders, running down my body. I can feel<br>your fingers circling on my skin. You’re enjoying this aren’t you?<br>
			I beg you to let me go, but you’ve made your way to the distorted parts of me.<br>
			Why do you touch me like I’m your gift, scented with honey and roses, suppressed<br>with silence and anger? You leave the room, creating the mess that I am. I’ve to<br>clean all by myself, again.<br>
			I want to cry my pain out with my favorite tunes and broken words. But you make me<br>feel like I’m incapable of singing in my rhythm. You make me feel like I cannot<br>feel elated by the heart wrenching pain you cause.
			<br>
			I choose to ignore your presence all night and pretend you’re in my head. I’m<br>lying on the bed. I fall asleep faster than I thought I could.<br>
			I wake up disturbed, I slept well though.<br>
			“There you are”, my anxiety greets me again, knocking on the doors to my mind.<br>
			I let my anxiety get to my head, again. But I’m going to have a good day, I promise.<br>
