I wake up disturbed, I slept well though.

You visit my thoughts the moment I open my eyes, like the sun wakes the Earth from its dreams.

But I’m going to have a good day, I promise. I see your alarming message soon after and believe otherwise.

Why do you take over my thoughts and pretend they are your toys to play with?

Why do you leave me in your ocean of uncertainties ; unattended? I’m drowning.

I met my love today. He loves me, I know. I want to say I do too. I can see you looking at me, smiling at my innocence and I refrain from accepting the truth.

Why am I afraid of you? Why do I let you in? Why do I let you shatter me? I’m broken pieces of glass lying on the floor.

Someone is going to bleed.

I had a long day, I wish to come home to myself but I see you waiting for me 
in my cave. I feel your arms on my shoulders, running down my body. I can feel 
your fingers circling on my skin. You’re enjoying this aren’t you?

I beg you to let me go, but you’ve made your way to the distorted parts of me.

Why do you touch me like I’m your gift, scented with honey and roses, suppressed
 with silence and anger? You leave the room, creating the mess that I am. I’ve to
 clean all by myself, again.

I want to cry my pain out with my favorite tunes and broken words. But you make me
 feel like I’m incapable of singing in my rhythm. You make me feel like I cannot 
feel elated by the heart wrenching pain you cause.

I choose to ignore your presence all night and pretend you’re in my head. I’m
 lying on the bed. I fall asleep faster than I thought I could.

I wake up disturbed, I slept well though.

“There you are”, my anxiety greets me again, knocking on the doors to my mind.

I let my anxiety get to my head, again. But I’m going to have a good day, I promise.
