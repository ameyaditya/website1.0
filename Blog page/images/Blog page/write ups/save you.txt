“Closed doors make you feel safe.
Darkness keeps you calm. 
Crying in your own arms helps you heal.
I respect that.

I can’t help you heal? I’ll dwell in your pain. 
I can’t stop your tears? I’ll let mine roll down my face.

Let me in, love. 
Let me see those scars, I’ll show you mine and we can sink into each other’s arms. 
Let me feel your pain and we can scream into the void in coherence.
Let me look at your flaws and love you anyway.

I’ll go easy on them, I promise. 
Open your heart out to me, I will protect it with all I have. 
Sing your sorrows to me, I will listen to them every second of the day. 
Write your loneliness to me, I will read it till I understand what you feel.

And honey, one day, you will sense the calm in open doors. You will see through the
 light and not be afraid anymore. You will close your eyes and go to sleep and 
realize there are no tears tonight.”
