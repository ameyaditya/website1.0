Press your lips against mine and  fill the voids of my universe that you have never seen

Brush the hair of my face while your eyes speak your desires  to me

Define my design and cause mayhem when our bodies gleam

Watch me spread chaos as you discover the softness of my scream

Come closer you can hear the sweet nothings my hands whisper as they run up your shin 

I'll give you two truths and one lie

I have done this before and I'm not high
 
All I want is for  you to untie

Say you'll guard my dreams and hold my hand 

Because tonight I've fallen in love with my one night stand
